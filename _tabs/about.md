Hi! I'm Zack, an BSc (Hons) Ethical Hacking graduate & now senior security analyst. Occasionally, I update my blog with talks, blue-team tips & tricks, or some interesting research I have completed while working on projects.

Feel free to follow me on social media where I occasionally post about events or interesting topics.
