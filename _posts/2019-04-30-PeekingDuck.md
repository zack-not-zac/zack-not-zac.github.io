The PeekingDuck application was made for use with Kali NetHunter on the Google Nexus 5, however, should work with any phone with a modified kernel which allows it to be recognised as a HiD-Compliant keyboard by an external device. A list of compatible devices can be found [here](https://github.com/pelya/android-keyboard-gadget). The application can be used to execute RubberDucky scripts, edit RubberDucky scripts on the device, & chain together multiple RubberDucky scripts.

This application was developed as part of a group project at university & is therefore not maintained - source code is available at <https://github.com/zack-not-zac/PeekingDuck>
